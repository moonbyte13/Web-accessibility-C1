# Module-1-Challenge

## Description
  I had alot of fun with this challenge. I was finding it very annoying to constantly be adjusting the containers using the padding and margins. Then my tutor explained flex to me and I found it much easier to align items and it also added the web responsiveness that we were learning about in Module 2!
